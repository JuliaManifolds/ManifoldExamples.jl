This package is a work in progress repository to host examples working with [Manifolds.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/) and accompanying code, illustrating the use of [Manifolds.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/) in reproducible [Quarto](https://quarto.org) notebooks.

Note that this package is not meant to introduce new manifolds themselves; these should be part of [Manifolds.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/) themselves, but focusses on applications where the manifolds are used numerically

A similar package providing reference implementations and example for [Manopt.jl](https://manoptjl.org/) optimisation problems, see [ManoptExamples.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/ManoptExamples.jl/).

The next steps here are

* Setup the documentation environment including rendering of Quarto notebooks
* setup the GitHub Action based CI for rendering
* add a changelog and a first example
